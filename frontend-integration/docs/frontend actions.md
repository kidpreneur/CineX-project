Yes, based on everything shared so far ‚Äî your backend is fully Clarity-based, you're using `stacks.js` for contract interactions, and there is **no need for a Node/Express backend** ‚Äî your frontend‚Äôs current `actions.md` is **mostly aligned** but can be slightly revised for clarity and focus.

Here is the **updated `frontend/tasks.md`**, now aligned strictly with:

* Hiro API and stacks.js only (no Node backend),
* Clarity contracts already written,
* Frontend only interacting with smart contracts and blockchain data.

# ‚úÖ `frontend/tasks.md` ‚Äì Updated Tasks for Blockchain-Only DApp Frontend

**Tech stack**: Vite + React + TypeScript + `stacks.js` + Hiro API + CSS Modules (`styles/` folder)
**No Node.js backend involved** ‚Äì all data/logic from Clarity smart contracts and Hiro API.

üìÑ Crowdfunding Campaign Feature Tasks (Clarity Backend)

    Write & Deploy Clarity Contract

        create-campaign function (store campaign data)

        fund-campaign function (receive contributions)

        get-campaigns read-only function (list all campaigns)

        get-campaign read-only function (fetch details)

        close-campaign function (finalize campaign)

    Setup Blockchain Connection

        Install Stacks.js (@stacks/transactions, @stacks/connect, @stacks/network)

        Configure contract address and network.

    Frontend Contract Interaction

        crowdfundingContract.ts:

            fetchCampaigns() ‚Äì call get-campaigns

            fetchCampaign(id) ‚Äì call get-campaign

            createCampaign() ‚Äì transaction to create-campaign

            fundCampaign() ‚Äì transaction to fund-campaign

    State Management

        Store campaigns in state.

        Handle loading/error states.

    Component Development

        Build CampaignList with blockchain data.

        Build CampaignDetail displaying live funding progress.

        Build CreateCampaignForm with transaction handling.

        Build FundCampaignModal sending transactions.

    Wallet Integration

        Connect Hiro Wallet.

        Show account balances.

        Require authentication before creating/funding campaigns.

    Routing

        /campaigns

        /campaigns/:id

        /campaigns/create

    Testing

        Test Clarity contract calls (mainnet/testnet).

        Validate transaction workflows.

## üìÅ Medium Tasks (Stacks.js, Context, Auth UI)

* [x] `useStacks.ts` for Stacks wallet connection (using `@stacks/connect`)
* [x] `clarityContracts.ts` for contract calls
* [x] `useAuth.ts`: handles wallet authentication, session
* [x] `AuthContext.tsx`: provide user session globally
* [x] Create reusable components:

  * `PrivateRoute.tsx`
  * `LoadingSpinner.tsx`
  * `ToastNotification.tsx`
* [x] User Dashboard (`Dashboard.tsx`)
* [x] Pool-related UI:

  * `PoolDetails.tsx`
  * `JoinPoolForm.tsx`
  * `PoolMembers.tsx`
* [x] Fund project UI (`FundProject.tsx`)
* [x] Proposal and verification forms:

  * `SubmitProposal.tsx`
  * `VerifyProposal.tsx`
  * `ProposalForm.tsx`

---

## üìÅ Complex Tasks (Contract Calls + Dynamic UI)

* [x] Contract call handlers:

  * `fundProject.ts`
  * `submitProposal.ts`
  * `verifyProposal.ts`
  * `releasePayment.ts`
  * `refundUser.ts`
* [x] Admin dashboard:

  * `AdminDashboard.tsx`
  * `AdminPanel.tsx`
* [x] Co-Film Maker view:

  * `TeamDashboard.tsx`
  * `ProposalTracking.tsx`
* [x] Implement pool group logic:

  * Create pool
  * Join pool
  * Withdraw/exit
  * Display member contributions and reward shares
* [x] Create dynamic dashboards for:

  * Users
  * Admins
  * Groups
* [ ] Add blockchain testnet support toggle (testnet/mainnet)
* [ ] Add real-time Hiro API integration to fetch tx status, contract states

---

## ‚úÖ Future Tasks / Improvements

* [ ] Add notification UI (on tx success/fail, proposal verified, etc.)
* [ ] Add responsive layout for mobile views
* [ ] Add unit and integration testing (Vitest)
* [ ] Add analytics integration
* [ ] Implement light/dark mode toggle
* [ ] Add error boundary and fallback UI
* [ ] Add chat module for group participants (optional)
* [ ] Add QR code wallet connect (optional)

---

## Notes

* All smart contract interactions are handled via `@stacks/connect` + `stacks.js` directly.
* Any blockchain data read (tx, pool states, balances) can come from Hiro API.
* No backend server exists ‚Äî avoid fetch calls to Node/Express API.
* All form submissions lead directly to `stacks.js` contract calls.
