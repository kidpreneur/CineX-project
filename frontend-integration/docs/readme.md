 the project is all about "is a decentralized application build on bitcoin ecosystem that caters for film makers independent film makers who do not have big budget at their disposal and therefore need an alternative source of financing , so this project help them with crowd funding functionalities so they can reach out to audiences on the blockchain by bypassing middlemen for raising this funds as well as having custudy of their funds or asset as the case maybe been able to reward those who backed the funding campaign reward them with different privillages which include the following - one giving them credits (when you said credit in film making you call out somebody for doing the good job like displaying their names on screen when movie has finished like this is the director, producer, marker, influencer, secretary etc that would help them get refferals etc that would be reference by coupon to redeem their benefits and this coupons is what i call nft i have build in the nft, second benefit i merchandise film makers who raise their funds through their supporters can decide to give their supporters branded merchandise about their movies (you know right now we have 2025 superman movies by james bond and is produced i think disney so imagine supports get that recognition for beeing the people the movie they crowdfunded ) three benefits - having access behind the scene production of the movie and many other benefits, some of this benefit have already been build into the system like i have coded them at the backend. aside that this project give film makers the opportunity to lock their funds as the funds are been raised money is been raised by the crowd that would have the opportunity to lock those funds for a period of time maybe ok i have year timeline to raise my funds then when this funds have been raised i could decide that while we are in pre production stage funds can be locked on defi (decentralized finance) pools where money can be releasing to people who want to trade with crypto token on the bitcoin ecosystem by so doing while this funds are been deploy to capital markets in decentralized space it yield interest to the film maker who has allowed their funds to be locked for a duration of period, and another thing to give it value addition to film makers who might like the the hope business model you know crowfunding is been on hope you are hoping that supporters would fund it fund your campaign and meets your target lets say target is to raise a thousand dollars for your film project maybe short film, documentaries, or whatever you are going to shoot and you are hoping because you are hoping that supporters would first of all like your project profile  you are hoping that after the like the project profile they would backed it contribute their token to it you are hoping that all of that would happen within the duration you are put for your funding campaign and you are hoping that eventually you will meet your target so the next thing we would explain the new model that helps to counter or should  i say that help to complement the funding campaign feature so while the film maker is hoping to meet their funding target within the funding duration there is the added advantage of doing something by the side to still raise money and that is call the core executive producer feature and in film making executive producers are the money bags they are the guys who print the money they dont necessary have to be fim makers to really fund film you have to have skin in the game so if you are a finacier of film you might not be a technical film maker but an investor in the film industry so for that reason this feature help film makers to actually reach out to core film makers like colleques who have shared experiences like them what i mean by that shared experience like mutual connection we have worked on projects in time ago or even currently we already know each other strengths and weaknessses we have a relationship together so they come together and form what is call "ajo" or "asusu" so what this ajo or asusu mean is like joining money together and keep one place so lets say we have 20 thousand dollas film budget and we are 20 each of the member should contribute a thousand dollars mean while the campaign is running so eventually when we are done there is code that immediately picked the first person who created the pool and that person movie is funded and there is a rotation like say sequence you are the first for your project to be funded and this other person is the second to be funded then this other person is that third person to be funded then fourth fifth continues in other after a period time all pool members their project would be funded and they each shared the benefit of been the supponsors or producers or financier of each other projects , remember there is an investment feature where those funds are locked in DEFI liquidity pool where people can trade loan and use this asset on bitcoin blockchain so all of that yield interest to this group of film funders and the circle continuos , so far all the feature i have been giving you have been build except two which is the investment the ability to lock the funds for a particular period so traders can used it i have not connected it to the mainnet and second the ability of film makers to be able to use not just only bitcoin but other tokens within the bitcoin ecosystem so that are not limited to one asset or crypto those two features have not been build . so am currently in stacks accent program stack is bitcoin next generation blockchain and it help bitcoin to be able to serve a command man with normal business solutions that bitcoin has not been able to do because bitcoin is only a stored of value buy and hold so when it appreciate you cash out that is all so with stack acend (am not sure of the correct spelling of acend) programe is an accelerator programme for technical funders on stack who have solutions that can be build on bitcoin network to serve the common man solutions that are in web 2 bring to web 3 and expand it for decentralized value am in that programme where they are rasing us as technical funders , is a competition who have am amazing project solutions to boost bitcoin ecosystem you do well you get incentify i got incentify the last round before i meet you now  am another level of the program and is much tougher i need scale and i cannot work along i need frontend developer creating frontend integration, there are a lot mentoring support and as we pass  each level after the .     You must separate the core Crowdfunding module from the Funding Pool module:

    Crowdfunding module: A single filmmaker launches a standalone campaign with:

        Their own profile

        A film project they want to raise money for

        No shared pool, just direct public funding

        Has a duration (countdown, e.g., 30 days)

        Option to lock the fund after the campaign
