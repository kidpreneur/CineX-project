 when working with **Vite + React + TypeScript + Stacks.js + Clarity smart contracts**, following a consistent and simple **standard checklist** ensures:

* Low complexity
* Easy debugging
* Faster development
* Better team collaboration
* Smart contract & frontend alignment

Here’s a clean **starter checklist** you can save to a file like:

📄 `docs/vite-react-typescript-stacks-clarity-checklist.md`

---

# ✅ Vite + React + TypeScript + Stacks.js + Clarity Smart Contract Checklist

## 1. 📦 Project Setup

* [ ] Use **Vite** with `--template react-ts`
* [ ] Ensure **TypeScript strict mode** is enabled (`tsconfig.json`)
* [ ] Use **ESLint + Prettier** for consistent code
* [ ] Install and lock these dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install @stacks/connect @stacks/transactions @stacks/network
  npm install @types/react-router-dom react-router-dom zustand
  ```

---

## 2. 🏗️ Folder Structure Best Practices

* Keep consistent folder separation:

  ```
  src/
    ├── components/
    ├── pages/
    ├── context/
    ├── hooks/
    ├── lib/           ← Clarity & contract helpers
    ├── services/      ← API, auth, or user services
    ├── store/         ← Zustand or context stores
    ├── utils/         ← Small helper functions
  ```

* Use **`.module.css`** for component-level styling

---

## 3. 🔐 Authentication (Stacks Wallet)

* [ ] Use `@stacks/connect` for login/logout
* [ ] Store auth state in global store (`useAuth()` hook or Zustand)
* [ ] Ensure wallet reconnect works on refresh
* [ ] Restrict sensitive routes with `<PrivateRoute />` component

---

## 4. ⚙️ Smart Contract Integration

* [ ] Store contract names & addresses in a central file `lib/clarityContracts.ts`
* [ ] Create wrapper functions in `lib/contractCalls/` for:

  * [ ] `submitProposal()`
  * [ ] `fundProject()`
  * [ ] `verifyProposal()`
  * [ ] `releasePayment()`
  * [ ] `refundUser()`
* [ ] Handle transaction signing, broadcasting, and status
* [ ] Always test contract functions in **testnet** first

---

## 5. 🧪 Testing & Debugging

* [ ] Always log and inspect transaction results
* [ ] Use browser **Developer Tools + Console** actively
* [ ] Display transaction feedback to users (pending, success, error)
* [ ] Prefer `async/await` and wrap with `try/catch`

---

## 6. 📈 UX Enhancements

* [ ] Show loading spinners during async calls
* [ ] Show user balance and investment summary
* [ ] Format numbers, dates, and addresses
* [ ] Use clear button states: disabled → loading → success

---

## 7. ⛑️ Developer Productivity

* [ ] Use environment variables (`.env`) for keys, networks, etc.
* [ ] Set up alias paths like `@components`, `@lib`, `@pages`
* [ ] Use `zustand` or `react context` for global state, not `useState` chains
* [ ] Document key functions and flows inside `/docs`

---

## 8. 🛡️ Clarity Contract Best Practices

* [ ] Follow `clarinet` conventions: write, test, deploy in sandbox
* [ ] Use `read-only` functions for querying data
* [ ] Structure contracts with clear logic separation
* [ ] Write simple, readable contract code with comments

---

## 9. 📚 Documentation

* [ ] Document all key components and contracts in `docs/`
* [ ] Include a project `README.md` with:

  * Setup steps
  * Stack description
  * How to deploy contracts
  * How to test features

---

## 10. 📤 Deployment Readiness

* [ ] Use `.env.production` for live builds
* [ ] Optimize Vite build with `vite.config.ts` tweaks
* [ ] Confirm contract is deployed and consistent with frontend config
* [ ] Host frontend on Netlify, Vercel, or AWS
