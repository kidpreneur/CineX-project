# CineX Platform: UI/UX Design Document

This document outlines the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design for the CineX platform, a decentralized crowdfunding platform for indie filmmakers.

## 1. Overall Vision & Principles

The CineX platform should feel modern, trustworthy, and inspiring. The design will be guided by the following principles:

*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** The interface will be clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate for all user types, from crypto-savvy investors to filmmakers.
*   **Transparency and Trust:** As a decentralized platform, all interactions with the blockchain will be clearly communicated to the user. Transaction statuses, fees, and contract details will be readily accessible.
*   **Cinematic Feel:** The design will evoke a sense of professionalism and creativity, fitting for a platform dedicated to filmmaking.
*   **Responsive and Accessible:** The platform will be fully responsive and accessible to users on all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

## 2. Branding & Style Guide

### Color Palette

The color palette is designed to be sophisticated, with a cinematic feel. A dark theme is proposed as the default to reduce eye strain and make visual content stand out.

*   **Primary Background:** Dark Charcoal (`#121212`) - Evokes a dark theater or editing room.
*   **Secondary Background:** Dark Slate (`#222222`) - For cards and elevated surfaces.
*   **Primary Text & Accents:** Warm Beige (`#F5F5DC`) - For body text and secondary UI elements.
*   **Primary Call-to-Action (CTA) & Highlights:** Vibrant Gold (`#FFBF00`) - To draw attention to key actions like "Fund Project" or "Connect Wallet".
*   **Success/Confirmation:** Green (`#28a745`) - For successful transactions, funded goals, etc.
*   **Error/Warning:** Red (`#dc3545`) - For failed transactions, error messages, and warnings.

### Typography

The typography will be modern, clean, and highly legible.

*   **Headings:** Poppins (SemiBold, Bold) - A stylish and modern sans-serif font for titles and headings.
*   **Body Text:** Inter (Regular) - A highly readable sans-serif font for paragraphs, labels, and other UI text.

### Iconography

A consistent icon set is crucial for a clean UI. We will use **Material Design Icons**.

*   **Navigation:** `home`, `dashboard`, `movie`, `account_balance_wallet`, `admin_panel_settings`
*   **Actions:** `add`, `thumb_up`, `thumb_down`, `check_circle`, `cancel`, `logout`
*   **Status:** `hourglass_empty` (pending), `check` (success), `error` (failed)

### Imagery & Visuals

*   **Film Stills:** High-quality, cinematic stills from the projects will be used as hero images and thumbnails. A subtle film-grain overlay will be applied to all images to maintain a consistent aesthetic.
*   **Thumbnails:** Project thumbnails will have a consistent 16:9 aspect ratio. On hover, they will display a play button to watch a trailer and a brief project summary.

### Micro-interactions & Animations

Subtle animations will be used to enhance the user experience and provide feedback.

*   **Hover Effects:** Buttons, links, and cards will have subtle hover effects (e.g., a slight lift or color change).
*   **Page Transitions:** Smooth fade-in/fade-out transitions between pages.
*   **Loading States:** Skeleton loaders will be used to show the structure of the content while it's loading. A small, elegant spinner will be used for button actions.
*   **Notifications:** Toast notifications will slide in from the top right of the screen to confirm actions or display errors.

## 3. User Roles & Personas

The platform will cater to three main user roles:

*   **Investor (General User):** Individuals who want to invest in film projects. They can browse projects, join funding pools, and track their investments.
*   **Filmmaker (Co-Filmmaker/Creator):** Individuals or teams who want to raise funds for their film projects. They can create campaigns, submit proposals for verification, and manage their projects.
*   **Admin:** Platform administrators who are responsible for managing users, verifying film proposals, and overseeing the platform's operations.

## 4. Key User Flows

The platform will support the following key user flows:

*   **User Registration & Wallet Connection:** Users will connect their Stacks wallet to register and log in to the platform.
*   **Project Discovery:** Investors can browse and filter film projects based on genre, funding goal, and other criteria.
*   **Project Funding:** Investors can fund projects directly or by joining a funding pool. The funding process will be a clear, multi-step process with transparent transaction details.
*   **Campaign Creation:** Filmmakers can create a new crowdfunding campaign by filling out a detailed form with project information, funding goals, and reward tiers.
*   **Film Verification:** Filmmakers can submit their projects for verification by the platform admins.
*   **Reward Claiming:** Investors can claim their NFT rewards for supporting a successful project.
