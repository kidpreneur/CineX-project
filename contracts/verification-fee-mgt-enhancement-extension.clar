;; title: verification-fee-mgt-enhancement-extension

;; Author: Victor Omenai 
;; Created: 2025
;; version: 1.0.0

;;;; ============= Description ==============
;; Complementary enhancements to the existing film verification fee system. 
;; Does NOT duplicate existing functionality, only adds value-added features

;; Strategic Purpose: Provides Value Proposition to the campaign creators, verifiers and the platform itself:
;;  - Good campaign creators get the value of getting re-verification without incurring full re-verification costs
;;  - Verifiers get the value of a verifier's treasury - a source of financial incentives for their verifying tasks
;;  - The platform gets a sustainable revenue model both in high market and low market periods, made possible by the value 
;;    of a market-based pricing system for verification and its attendant dynamic fee adjustment multiplier  

;; Reference to main verification module for integration

;; ========== ADDITIONAL ERROR CONSTANTS ==========
(define-constant ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED (err u2000))
(define-constant ERR-VERIFICATION-ADMIN-NOT-FOUND (err u2001))
(define-constant ERR-RENEWAL-TOO-EARLY (err u2002));; Trying to renew too soon
(define-constant ERR-INSUFFICIENT-BALANCE (err u2003)) 
(define-constant ERR-INVALID-FEE-ADJUSTMENT (err u2004))

;; ========== ADDITIONAL CONSTANTS ==========
;; Discount percentages (complementing existing fees) for renewal of verification
(define-constant VERIFICATION-RENEWAL-DISCOUNT-PERCENT u50) ;; 50% discount for renewals 

;; Fee adjustment limits (market-based pricing)
    ;; @func: charges more during busy times and less during quiet times. The system therefore can adjust verification fees based on demand
(define-constant MIN-FEE-MULTIPLIER u50) ;; 50% of base fee (minimum) when demand is high
(define-constant MAX-FEE-MULTIPLIER u20) ;; 200% of base fee (maximum) when demand is disturbingly low

;; Revenue sharing (new-feature)
(define-constant PLATFORM-SHARE u70) ;; 70% to platform treasury
(define-constant VERIFIER-SHARE u30) ;; 30% to verification team

;; ========== ADDITIONAL DATA VARIABLES ==========
;; Dynamic Fee- Adjustment Multiplier (complements fixed verification fees in main film verification module)  
(define-data-var fee-adjustment-multiplier uint u100) ;; works as a Current price multiplier (100 = normal pricing, 150 = 50% more expensive)

;; Revenue distribution addresses
(define-data-var platform-treasury principal tx-sender)
(define-data-var verifiers-treasury principal tx-sender)

;; Reference to main verification module
(define-data-var verification-module principal tx-sender)

;; Current-revenue period counter - Keeping track of which distribution period we're on
(define-data-var current-revenue-period-counter uint u0)

;; ========== ADDITIONAL DATA MAPS ==========
;; Track filmmaker payment history  (complements existing fee tracking in the film-verification-module)
(define-map filmmaker-payment-history { filmmaker: principal, payment-index: uint } { 
    amount: uint,
    verification-level: uint,
    payment-type: (string-ascii 10), ;; for "initital verification" or "renewal"
    blockheight: uint,
    fee-multiplier: uint ;; what multiplier was used for a unique payment 
    })

;; Payment counters per filmmaker 
        ;; @func: counts how many verfication payments each filmmaker has made
(define-map filmmaker-verification-payments principal uint) ;; tracks each payment index by the tx-sender of unique filmmaker

;; Revenue distribution tracking (complements main module's total tracking)
    ;; ;; Like a financial report showing the distribution of verification payments between the CineX platform and verifiers treasury
(define-map revenue-distribution uint { 
    period-start: uint, ;; when a distribution perod started
    period-end: uint, ;; when a distribution period ended
    total-collected: uint,
    platform-amount: uint, ;; how much went to the platform
    verifier-amount: uint, ;; how much went to the verifiers
    distributed: bool ;; whether money has been sent out or not 
    })      


;; ========== ADMIN FUNCTIONS ==========
;; Set verification module reference
(define-public (set-verification-module (new-module principal))
    (begin 
    ;; ensure only platform treasury can initially set the address for the film-verification module
        (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender (var-get platform-treasury)) ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED)
        (var-set verification-module new-module)
        (ok true)    
    )  
)

;; Set platform treasury address
(define-public (set-platform (verification-address <fee-enhancement-verification-module>) (new-platform principal))
    (begin 
        (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender 
                            (unwrap! (contract-call? verification-address get-contract-admin) ERR-VERIFICATION-ADMIN-NOT-FOUND))
             ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED)  
        (var-set platform-treasury new-platform)
        (ok new-platform)
        
    )
)

;; Set verifiers treasury address
(define-public (set-verifier (verification-address <fee-enhancement-verification-module>) (new-verifier principal)) 
    (begin 
        (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender 
                            (unwrap! (contract-call? verification-address get-contract-admin) ERR-VERIFICATION-ADMIN-NOT-FOUND))
             ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED)  
        (var-set verifiers-treasury new-verifier)
        (ok new-verifier)
    )
    
)
